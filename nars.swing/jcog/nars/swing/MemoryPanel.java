/**
 * Memory control: The administrator can reset the memory to empty, save the current memory to a permanent storage, or load a saved memory to replace (not merge with) the current memory. The administrator should be able to manually edit the memory by create/delete/modify a concept, a task, or a belief.
 * 
 *  Observers can watch the rum-time activity within the system in a browser, without any impact to the system.

		An observer can watch the content of the memory (in terms of concepts), the task buffer (in terms of tasks), and a concept (in terms of tasks and beliefs). The content can be displayed as a static snap-shot, or a dynamic moving picture. In either way, the user should be able to specify thresholds and options, so as to focus on the most prominent features. It should be easy for the observer to move the view point, or to zoom in/out.

		The observer can follow the inference engine step by step, and see the premises and conclusions.

		Help information should be available to briefly explain the data, as well as to guide the user's activities.
